Scalemate is a psychological scales engine for C#. Any test composed of written of questions and answers can be implemented here.

Scalemate Structure
-------------------

The engine is divided into a library (in the `Scalemate` project) and a graphical user interface (in the `ScalemateForms` project, implemented for Microsoft Windows).

<!-- TODO Add information about how the library is implemented. -->

Test structure
--------------

A test is composed of a folder containing two files: `inventory.txt` and `results.txt`. There can also be three other optional files: `instructions.txt`, `finish.txt`, and `information.txt`.

### Inventory File ###

The first line of the inventory file is the number of possible answers in each question. The following lines must contain the question (or an empty line if there is no question) and the possible answers. Note there must be as many answers as indicated in this file's header.

If needed, a `*` can be added before the question to reverse its score.

### Results file ###

The results file describe how to score a test. The answers in an inventory file are worth their index minus 1. That is, the first answer is worth 0 points; the second answer is worth 1 point; the third answer is worth 2 points; and so on. The app will store the answers given by the user, and then it will sum their values, and give a result based on this results' file. Each line will contain a floor value, a ceiling value and the result corresponding to this gap. If the score is equal to or bigger than the floor, or if the score is smaller than the ceiling value, then Scalemate will select the diagnosis related to these values.

### Instructions files ###

The presence of an `instructions.txt` in the test folder will add a window before the test with the text written in this file. Its purpose is to give instructions to the subject.

There can also be a `finish.txt` to instruct the subject on how to proceed after the test is completed.

### Information file ###

In case some information from the subject is required for that test, this `information.txt` will add another window before the test execution with the questions added in this file. Each line will consist of a question that must answered by the user, whose input will appear in the results file.

Results folder
--------------

The results folder will store the data generated by the many tests taken in Scalemate. Each file is a `csv` table named after who took the test and which test was taken, and will contain the relevant information from the user, the result as given by Scalemate and the answers given.
