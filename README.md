Scalemate is a psychological scales platform for Microsoft Windows. Any test composed of written of questions and answers can be implemented here.

Test structure
--------------

A test if composed of a folder containing two files: `inventory.txt` and `results.txt`.

### Inventory File

The first line of the inventory file is the number of possible answers in each question. The following lines must contain the question (or an empty line if there is no question) and the possible answers. Note there must be as many answers as indicated in this file's header.

### Results file

The results file describe how to score a test. The answers in an inventory file are worth their index minus 1. That is, the first answer is worth 0 points; the second answer is worth 1 point; the third answer is worth 2 points; and so on. The app will store the answers given by the user, and then it will sum their values, and give a result based on this results' file. Each line will contain a floor value, a ceiling value and the result corresponding to this gap. If the score is equal to or bigger then the floor, or if the score is smaller than the ceiling value, then Scalemate will write the diagnosis related to these values.

Results folder
--------------

The results folder will store the data generated by the many tests taken in Scalemate. Each file is a `csv` table named after who took the test and which test was taken, and will contain the revelant information from the user, the result as given by Scalemate and the answers given.
