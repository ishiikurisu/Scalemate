<h2 id="test-structure">Test structure</h2>
<p>A test if composed of a folder containing two files: <code>inventory.csv</code> and <code>results.csv</code>. There can also be three other optional files: <code>instructions.txt</code>, <code>information.txt</code>, and <code>finish.txt</code>.</p>
<p>All <code>*.csv</code> files must be tab (<code>&#92;t</code> characters) seperated values files.</p>
<h3 id="inventory-file">Inventory File</h3>
<p>This file describes the inventory per se, that is, what the subject will see. This file is a table whose first column is the question to be asked and the following columns are the possible answers for these columns. The answers in an inventory file are worth their index minus 1. That is, the first answer is worth 0 points; the second answer is worth 1 point; the third answer is worth 2 points; and so on. Every line must have the same number of columns.</p>
<p> Whenever needed, an asterisk (<code>&#42;</code>) can be added to the beginning of the question to invert the scoring logic (e.g. the answers are worth the number of possible answers minus 1 minus their index).</p>
<h3 id="results-file">Results file</h3>
<p>The results file describe how to score a test. The application will store the answers given by the user, and then it will sum their values, and give a result based on this results&#39; file. Each line will contain a floor value on the first row, a ceiling value on the second row, and the result text corresponding to this gap. If the score is equal to or bigger than the floor and is smaller than the ceiling value, then Scalemate will select the diagnosis related to these values.</p>
<h3 id="instructions-file">Instructions file</h3>
<p>The presence of an <code>instructions.txt</code> in the test folder will add a window before the test with the text written in this file. Its purpose is to give instructions to the subject.</p>
<p>There can also be a <code>finish.txt</code> to instruct the subject on how to proceed after the test is completed.</p>
<h3 id="information-file">Information file</h3>
<p>In case some information from the subject is required for that test, this <code>information.txt</code> will add another window before the test execution with the questions added in this file. Each line will consist of a question that must answered by the user, whose input will appear in the results file.</p>
<h2 id="results-folder">Results folder</h2>
<p>The results folder will store the data generated by the many tests taken in Scalemate. Each file is a <code>csv</code> table named after who took the test and which test was taken, and will contain the revelant information from the user, the result as given by Scalemate and the answers given.</p>
