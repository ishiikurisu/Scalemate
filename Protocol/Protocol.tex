\title{Scalemate: Psychological Tests Platform}
\author{Cristiano Silva JÃºnior}
\date{}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Let's talk about this psychological tests platform, written by me. I wrote it
using C\#, trying to show that every test can be implemented using a queue
and a simple sum system. Of course, that is not the real abstract. 
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Write about our motivations and tools.

\section{Methodology}

This is where I am supposed to spend my time now. What a pity I will not use
equations.
$$F(u)(w) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} u(x)e^{-\jmath x w} dx$$
I like them so much.
